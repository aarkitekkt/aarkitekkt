                        <p className="text-white">Iâ€™m a full stack developer with an emphasis on front end development and a background in architecture and design. With a Full Stack Web Development certificate, a Master of Architecture, and professional experience in graphic design, industrial design, and 3D rendering/animation, I am adaptable and always looking to develop new skills in order to create user-focused experiences.  My strength is being able to combine design-thinking and problem solving with the willingness to learn new skills in order to produce creative outcomes.  Working alongside many talented students and design professionals, I have completed a variety of projects including building a web application to track earthquake data, designing a system to rapidly prototype and build a series of iPad enclosures, creating 3d animations to play inside convenience stores, and building a home for a family on the Navajo Indian Reservation in southeastern Utah. </p>

                            In addition to my love of design, I am an avid hiker, skier, three-time marathoner, and a huge
                            soccer fan. I enjoy exploring the outdoors, working on my house, and watching soccer games with
